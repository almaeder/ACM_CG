# PASC24 ACM SRC
## A Distributed Conjugate Gradient Solver for Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations Under Applied Fields
Test of different communication schemes and other optimizations for the standard preconditioned conjugate gradient method.

The code used in [KMC](https://github.com/manasakani/DeviceKMC)

## TODO 
- other preconditioners (only jacobi, ILU, icholesky available)
- constructors are not final and only for test purposes
- naming revamp
- explanation on how to use the code
